# Sonic
Sonic presents a new SNARKs protocol with the benefit of the updateability of its Universal SRS (structured reference string) with the size linear in the size of the arithmetic circuit that describes the computational statement being proven. URS is circuit independent and can be used for the proofing system of many circuits whose size (depth) is limited by the URS size.

The source code of this repository implements the Sonic proofing system with Helper support.
